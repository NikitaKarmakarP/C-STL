# C++ STL Fundamentals ðŸ“˜

Welcome to the **Cpp-STL-Fundamentals** repository! This collection is designed to provide a comprehensive understanding of the **Standard Template Library (STL)** in C++. It includes examples, detailed explanations, and time complexity insights for key STL components like containers, iterators, and algorithms.

## Introduction

The **Standard Template Library (STL)** in C++ is a powerful library that provides several generic classes and functions to work with data structures and algorithms efficiently. This repository is designed to help you get a solid understanding of STL in a simple and concise way, providing real-world examples and explanations.

## Overview

The **Standard Template Library (STL)** in C++ is a collection of powerful, pre-defined templates that allow you to efficiently handle data structures and algorithms. Whether you are new to C++ or looking to sharpen your skills, this repository is a great place to learn and experiment with the STL.

## In this repository, you'll find:
- Clear explanations of each STL container, iterator, and algorithm
- Time complexity analysis of STL operations
- Practical examples demonstrating common use cases

## What is C++ STL?
C++ is one of the most popular high-level programming language which is used extensively for a long time by developers and has always been loved by all programmers, especially competitive programmers because of its faster execution time.

STL is one of the unique abilities of C++ which makes it stand out from every other programming language. STL stands for standard template library which contains a lot of pre-defined templates in terms of containers and classes which makes it very easy for developers or programmers to implement different data structures easily without having to write complete code and worry about space-time complexities.

If you dive a little deeper into STL, you will have to understand everything about templates and how they work, which is one of the most power full tools when it comes to C++ programming language.

## C++ STL divided into 4 parts

- Algorithm
- Containers
- Functions
- Iterators

## However, in this repository we will stick to some of the most popular STL containers and algorithms, and its useful functions which is used by programmers very frequently in day to day programming.
